            To delve deep into the book of life, study the forces which connect the past to the present and connect man to man, is the board goal of any literature, but specifically of the Honours Syllabus in Hindi. This revised syllabus, addressing today's dynamic circumstances, acquaints students with Hindi writing spread over a thousand years and also instructs them in language teaching, translation and writing for the mass media. Apart from pursuing a Masters, a graduate in the subject can opt for further education in teacher's training, mass communication or enter fields like journalism and translation. The Faculty here comprises experienced academicians dedicated to the cause of teaching.</p>
