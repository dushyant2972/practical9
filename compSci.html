            A degree in Computer Science provides the needed thrust for aspirants in the field of Information Technology, with its curricula including the core Computer Science subjects along with Electronics, Mathematics, Technical Writing, Commerce and Economics. Being a pervasive discipline for all science and humanities courses, it encourages students to pursue various inter - disciplinary interests. Students can pursue various post graduate courses like M.Sc., M.C.A. and M.B.A. apart from the choice of taking up placements that are offered to them by companies that require their expertise as computer science graduates. The well qualified and dedicated faculty provides guidance in academics, higher studies, research and placement of our students. Exposure to emerging trends and technologies, aids us to facilitate growth that strengthens the knowledge base of the students.
